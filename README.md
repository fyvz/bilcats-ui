## 💡 **Motivation**

Living with campus animals is a part of life at **Bilkent University**.  
There’s already a wonderful community, **Bilkent Animal Friends** (_Bilkent Hayvan Dostları_), who take care of our furry friends.

However, communication mainly happens through **WhatsApp**, and during long breaks or after graduation, students lose touch 😿  
We wanted to change that — to keep our **cats and caretakers connected** all year long.

That’s how **BilCats** was born — a cozy web platform for Bilkent’s cats and their friends! 🎉
