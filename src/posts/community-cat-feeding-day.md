## Community Cat Feeding Day 🍲

*Date: October 5, 2025*  
*Type: Event*

---

Let’s come together to support our campus cats! 🐱  

On **October 5th at 3 PM**, BilCats is organizing the very first **Community Cat Feeding Day**. Volunteers and students will gather near the main library entrance to distribute food, water, and some well-deserved affection to our furry friends.  

**What to bring:**  
- Cat food (dry or wet)  
- Water bottles & bowls  
- A little patience for the shy kitties  

Whether you bring supplies or just show up to help, your presence makes a difference. Let’s make sure no cat goes hungry! 🧡
