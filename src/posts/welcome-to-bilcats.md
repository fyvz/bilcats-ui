BilCats is live! 🎉 This is your new community hub for everything related to our beloved campus cats. Whether you want to:

- Meet and learn about the cats roaming our campus  
- Share photos, stories, and experiences  
- Organize adoption, feeding, or donation efforts  
- Chat with other cat lovers  

…you now have a home for all of it.  

We built BilCats not just as an app, but as a community. Every profile, post, and picture helps us connect with one another while making sure our cats are cared for.  

So sign up, explore, and maybe even adopt a furry friend. Together, we’ll make BilCats thrive! 🐱❤️
