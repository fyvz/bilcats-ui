As temperatures drop, life on campus gets tougher for our feline friends. Here are a few simple ways you can make winter safer and more comfortable for them:  

### 1. Provide Shelter 🏠  
Cardboard boxes lined with blankets or DIY wooden shelters placed in quiet corners can help cats escape the wind and cold.  

### 2. Offer Warm Food & Water 🍲  
Cats burn extra energy to stay warm. Feeding them nutrient-rich food and making sure their water doesn’t freeze is essential.  

### 3. Check Under Cars 🚗  
Cats often crawl under or even into car engines for warmth. Before starting your car, tap the hood or honk the horn to give them a chance to move away.  

### 4. Spread Awareness 📢  
Not everyone realizes how vulnerable outdoor cats are in winter. Share these tips with friends and fellow students to create a safer campus for all.  

Together, small acts of kindness can make the biggest difference. Let’s make sure our campus cats stay warm and safe this winter. 💙
