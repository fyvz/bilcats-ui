We’re thrilled to share BilCats’ very first adoption success story! 🎉  

Mia, a shy calico who spent most of her days around the engineering building, has finally found a warm and loving home. After being featured on the BilCats app, her profile caught the attention of Ayşe, a third-year student who had been looking to adopt.  

Within a week, Mia was welcomed into her new home. Ayşe reports that Mia is already exploring every corner of the house and enjoying cozy naps on her new bed. 🐱✨  

This is just the beginning. Every adoption means a safer, happier life for our campus cats — and it’s thanks to the support of this community. Keep sharing, keep caring, and let’s make many more stories like Mia’s possible!
